The simplest and most intuitive Python collection is a list. To create a list, square brackets are used:\n","```python\n","my_list = []\n","type(my_list)\n","```\n","\n","Lists can store any values: numbers, strings, booleans, other variables, even other lists or collections.\n","\n","A list can be created with elements already provided:\n","```python\n","my_list = [1, 2.0, \"three\", [4, 5]]\n","```\n","\n","Elements in lists are ordered, so each element can be accessed using an index. The process of getting a value by an index is called indexation:\n","```python\n","my_list[0]\n","```\n","\n","You can select multiple elements by specifying a range:\n","\n","```python\n","my_list[1:3]\n","```\n","Here, the syntax is **start:end**. Remember that numbering begins at 0 in Python. To select elements counting from the back of the list, use negative numbers.\n","\n","If you try to get an element by a non-existing index (bigger than the length of the list), you will get an error (`IndexError`):\n","\n","```python\n","my_list[4]\n","```\n","\n","Main functions to know and use with lists:\n","* `len(x)` returns the length of the `x` list. Returns a new value.\n","* `x.append(a)` appends the value of the `a` variable to the end of the `x` list. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.insert(index, a)` inserts `a` in the place specified by the index. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.extend([a])` extends the list x with another list. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.remove(a)` will remove first occurence of the `a` value from list. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.pop(a)` removes the element of index `a`, and also returns the value of `a`. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.clear()` removes everything from the list. Does it **in-place**.\n","* `x.index(a)` finds the index of the `a` value inside `x`. Returns a new value.\n","  * If there are copies of `a` values, will return the index for first occurence: `[1, 2, 2, 3].index(2)` will always return 1.\n","* `x.count(a)` counts the number of `a` values inside `x`. Returns a new value.\n","* `sorted(x)`  returns a new list with is a sorted copy of `x`. Values are sorted from smaller to bigger.\n","* `x.sort()` sorts the list **in-place**.\n","* `''.join(x)` converts the list to string by concatenating all values together.  Returns a new value.\n","  * You can add a symbol between values, e.g. `','.join(['a', 'b', 'c'])` will return `'a,b,c'`.\n","\n","**Understand the difference between inplace changes and creating copies**\n","\n","Let's check two very similar functions: `sorted(x)` and `x.sort()`:\n","```python\n","x = [5, 7, 6, 8]\n","print('The sorted function returns a copy:', sorted(x))\n","print('You can see that the original lis}t remains unchanged:', x)\n","print('But .sort() does not return anything: ', x.sort())\n","print('And the original list is now changed:', x)\n","```"],"metadata":{"id":"L8gPnDDnq54E"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Exercises:\n","\n","1.
