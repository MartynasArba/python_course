Install [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) or [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/)\n","3. Install an IDE. [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html), which comes pre-installed with Anaconda Navigator, or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are recommended.\n","4. If using VSCode, check out extensions. See anything with Jupyter or Python in the title. Required extensions usually pop up when trying to run code.\n","5. Create and activate an environment with `python=3.12`, create a Jupyter notebook, and run `print('whatever')`."],"metadata":{"id":"Aag9AI_nHrWU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Fundamentals\n","1. Create any variable and assign a value to it.\n","2. Check the value of this variable by printing it and seeing the cell output\n","3. See the value of the variable three times in a row by copy-pasting what you did previously\n","4. Assign a new value to the same variable. Make this variable a number\n","5. Check whether the variable is equal to the number that was assigned\n","6. `None` can be used to initialize a variable, but means nothing by itself. It can also be used to check whether a variable has been set\n","7.

Calculate the value of the expression below using your phone and doing one step at a time. Then, write this expression in Python.

Check their types using `type()`. Why do you think there is a difference?\n","3. Convert the second variable to type `int` using the function `int()` and print its value. What changed?\n","4. Check if 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 is equal to 0.3. [Why does this happen?](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html) Try to use the `round()` function to solve this.\n","5. Import and print the value of pi from the `math` library.\n","6.

Rewrite the previous exercise using the `**` operator instead of `math.sqrt()`.\n","8. The modulus (`%`) operator gives the remainder of two numbers. This can be used to check whether one is divisible by another (for example, even or odd). Use this operator to check whether 427 is divisible by 7.\n","9. Create two variables. Update one of them to be equal to itself plus the other variable. Use the `+=` operator.\n","10.

Create a variable that is of the `string` type. Try to multiply it by two.\n","2. Create another variable. Try to add them together.\n","3. Create a `string` variable containing numbers. Try to add a number, then convert this variable to the `int` type to access numerical operations.\n","4. Multi strings are strings spanning multiple lines. This can be done using triple quotes: `\"\"\"`. Rewrite this string as a multi line string: `text = \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\"`\n","5.

The `if` statement can be used to execute code conditionally. `else` is executed if the `if` statement is `False`. Use the `if` statement to check whether a variable is divisible by 9, and print yes or no based on the variable. If you want to include multiple statement checks, use the \"else if\" statement `elif`, which runs when `if` statement is false, but checks another condition.\n","2.
